# Razvoj-Moblinih-Aplikacija

This project was developed for a university course Mobile Application Development.

Built an android app for card collectors using Java and the Scryfall API. 

Users can create an account and search for and add cards to their collection, view card details and price.

The project included android concepts like Location and Shake detection. 

When a user shakes their device they will view card details of a random card. Location service points them to a local card shop in Novi Sad.
